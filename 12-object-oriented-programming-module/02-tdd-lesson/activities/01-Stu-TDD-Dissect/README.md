# TDD Dissect

In this activity, you will work with a partner to dissect the provided testing example.

## Instructions

* Open the `index.js` file in your code editor and try to guess what what the code does. What do you think will be printed to the console in this example?

* Install dependencies by running `npm install` in your terminal, then run `node index.js`. Was your guess correct? How do you think the method chaining is achieved?

* Open the `arithmetic.js` file in your code editor. What do you think the significance of the `plus` and `minus` methods returning `new Arithmetic` is? How does this relate to the method chaining you saw in the `index.js` file?

* Open `test/arithmetic.test.js`. What is the significance of the `expect` function? What does `toEqual` do? What about the `describe` and `it` functions? Where are these coming from?

* Once you've had some time to consider the above, run `npm run test` in your terminal and examine the output. Do you have a better idea of what the `describe` and `it` functions might be used for?

* Have any conclusions, as well as remaining questions, ready to share during the activity review.
