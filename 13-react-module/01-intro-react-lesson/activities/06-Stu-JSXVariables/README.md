# JSX Variables

* In this activity, we will render JavaScript expressions inside of JSX curly braces.

## Instructions

* Replace your React application's `src` folder with [starter/src](starter/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm run dev`.

* This activity uses Bootstrap, so make sure to add `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';` and `import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap'` in `main.jsx`.

* Open `src/components/JSXVariables.jsx` and notice the values being requested inside of the component:

  * Your name

  * The number of letters in your name

  * What you think about React

* Render each value inside of JSX curly braces. You will need to create JavaScript variables in order to accomplish this.

## BONUS

* Add another heading that says "My name without any vowels is: <insert name without vowels here>". Create a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the string with the vowels removed. Run this function inside of JSX curly braces to complete the statement.
