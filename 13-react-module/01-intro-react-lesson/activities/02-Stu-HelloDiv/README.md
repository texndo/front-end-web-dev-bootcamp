# HelloDiv

In this activity, we will render a list of JSX elements inside of a div.

## Instructions

* Replace the `src` folder of your React app with [src](starter/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm run dev`.

* Using the code in the [HelloDiv.jsx](starter/src/components/HelloDiv.jsx) file as a starting point, update the `HelloDiv` function so that it returns the following JSX:

  * A heading tag introducing yourself (e.g., `<h1>Hello! My name is <insert name here></h1>`).

  * An unordered list containing at least three things you like (these can be anything).

## üìù Notes

* You will notice that in the components, we are importing in the React library. While this is not technically necessary as of React v17, it is still best practice to add it. We will explore why in future modules. 

### Hints

* Reference the previous `HelloReact` activity if you get stuck with any syntax.

* If you're trying to render multiple JSX tags from a single component, you should enclose all of the JSX tags within a single parent tag, such as a `div`.
