# useState

In this activity, we will practice using the useState Hook in React.

## Instructions

* Replace your React application's src folder with [starter/src](starter/src).

* If you created a new React app, you will need to install Bootstrap by running `npm i --save bootstrap @popperjs/core` and adding `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';` and `import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap'` in `main.jsx`.

* Start the application in dev mode by running `npm run dev` in your terminal.

* Open your browser to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and study the rendered application.

* Update this application to accomplish the following:

* In `pages/Signup/index.jsx`, replace `NAME_HERE` and `PASSWORD_HERE` with code that will display both the name and password.

* The state of the Signup component should be handled by the `useState` Hook.

* When the value of an input field changes, the state should update, causing the component to render.

* Upon form submission, the `handleSubmit` method should `console.log` the username and password.
