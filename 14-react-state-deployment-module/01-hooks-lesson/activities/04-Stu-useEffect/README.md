# useEffect

In this activity, we will practice using the useState and useEffect Hooks by updating an incomplete component.

## Instructions

Resolve the following issue:

* As a user, I want to be able to type a search term into the input field and see a dynamically generated URL appear in the section below.

* Replace your React application'sÂ srcÂ folder with [starter/src](starter/src).

* If you created a new React app, you will need to install Axios, React Router, and Bootstrap.

* Start the application in dev mode by running `npm run dev` in your terminal.

* Open your browser toÂ [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)Â and study the rendered application.

* Update this application to accomplish the following:

  1. Update the call to the `useEffect` Hook:

      * Fix the `useEffect` hook so that it triggers only when the user enters text into the search bar, instead of running after every state change.

      * Update `title` and `url` using the response of the API call.

  2. Fix the `handleInputChange` function to ensure that the intended Wikipedia URL is correctly shown on the page.

## ðŸ’¡ Hints  

* Only one page needs to be modified for this activity. Which file is it?
